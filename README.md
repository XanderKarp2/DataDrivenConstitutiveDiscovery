# DataDrivenConstitutiveDiscovery

There are a lot of files in this repository but the only one that matters is thermSR.  You should be able to run that as a standalone script.  There are a few other cool codes like the BINDy and SINDy codes, but to run these you must run testing.py in the same directory as SINDy.py or Bindy.py and sampling.py
